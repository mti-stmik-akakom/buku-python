# Instalasi Python - Miniconda

Pada umumnya, komputer yang diinstall Linux sudah mempunyai Python. Meskipun demikian, seringkali versi yang ada masih versi lama. Proses uninstall untuk kasus tersebut juga tidak memungkinkan karena biasanya akan membuat banyak software lainnya menjadi tidak bisa digunakan di komputer tersebut (broken). Miniconda memungkinkan kita menginstall versi stabil maupun versi lainnya. Distribusi Miniconda bisa diperoleh di https://conda.io/miniconda.html. Contoh instalasi akan diberikan untuk Linux 64 bit dan Python versi 3. Download pada lokasi di atas, setelah itu jalankan file tersebut setelah di - chmod:

```bash
» chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 
» ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 

Welcome to Miniconda3 4.5.11

Setelah itu, atur environment variable (variabel lingkungan) pada file dan source file tersebut setiap kali ingin menjalankan Python dari Anaconda. Jika menggunakan shell fish:

```bash
» cat env-fish/anaconda/miniconda3 
set -x PATH /opt/software/python-dev-tools/miniconda3/bin $PATH
» source env-fish/anaconda/miniconda3

usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...
 
conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.
 
Options:
 
positional arguments:
  command
    clean        Remove unused packages and caches.
    config       Modify configuration values in .condarc. This is modeled
                 after the git config command. Writes to the user .condarc
                 file (/home/bpdp/.condarc) by default.
    create       Create a new conda environment from a list of specified
                 packages.
    help         Displays a list of available conda commands and their help
                 strings.
    info         Display information about current conda install.
    install      Installs a list of packages into a specified conda
                 environment.
    list         List linked packages in a conda environment.
    package      Low-level conda package utility. (EXPERIMENTAL)
    remove       Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment.
    uninstall    Alias for conda remove. See conda remove --help.
    search       Search for packages and display associated information. The
                 input is a MatchSpec, a query language for conda packages.
                 See examples below.
    update       Updates conda packages to the latest compatible version. This
                 command accepts a list of package names and updates them to
                 the latest versions that are compatible with all other
                 packages in the environment. Conda attempts to install the
                 newest versions of the requested packages. To accomplish
                 this, it may update some packages that are already installed,
                 or install additional packages. To prevent existing packages
                 from updating, use the --no-update-deps option. This may
                 force conda to install older versions of the requested
                 packages, and it does not prevent additional dependency
                 packages from being installed. If you wish to skip dependency
                 checking altogether, use the '--force' option. This may
                 result in an environment with incompatible packages, so this
                 option must be used with great caution.
    upgrade      Alias for conda update. See conda update --help.
 
optional arguments:
  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version  Show the conda version number and exit.
 
conda commands available from other packages:

Jika menggunakan shell Bash:

```bash
» cat env-bash/anaconda/miniconda3 
export PATH=/opt/software/python-dev-tools/miniconda3/bin:$PATH
» source env-bash/anaconda/miniconda3

Jika menggunakan Windows, instalasi dengan Windows installer sudah melakukan berbagai konfigurasi sehingga bisa menjalankan langsung dari command prompt. Jika langkah-langkah di atas bisa dilakukan, maka Python dan conda sudah terinstall. Python akan digunakan untuk menjalankan source code dalam bahasa pemrograman Python, sementara conda akan digunakan untuk mengelola paket serta variabel lingkungan.
